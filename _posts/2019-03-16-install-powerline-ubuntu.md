Learn how to install the Powerline status plugin for vim, bash, tmux, and
others.

Powerline is a text-based tool that provides useful information in a variety of
contexts. The following screenshot shows Powerline displaying information about
a Git repository:

## Install and configure Powerline fonts

To install the Powerline fonts:

1. Clone the Powerline fonts repository to the `fonts` folder in your computer:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1 fonts
   ```
1. Run the installation script:
   ```shell
   ./fonts/install.sh
   ```

To configure the fonts in the Ubuntu Terminal app:

1. Open Terminal.
1. Go to **Edit** > **Preferences**.
1. In the **Editing Profile** dialog, choose the **General** tab, enable
   **Custom font**, and click the button to select a font.
1. From the **Choose a Terminal Font** dialog, select one of the Powerline
   fonts, such as **Source Code Pro for Powerline Regular**.

While you are in the **Editing Profile** dialog, check the different color
schemes in the **Colors** tab. You might find one that works better for you than
the default.

## Install pip and Powerline

Powerline is available in pip, which is a package manager for Python. To install
pip:

```sh
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py --user
rm get-pip.py
```

To install Powerline:

```sh
~/.local/bin/pip install --user powerline-status
```

The `--user` flag indicates that pip installs the package following the _user
scheme_. In other words, the package is installed in a location specific to the
current user.

## Configure Bash

To configure Powerline for bash, add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc`
file:

```sh
# Add this to your PATH if itâ€™s not already declared
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin

# Powerline configuration
if [ -f ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh ]; then
    ~/.local/bin/powerline-daemon -q
    POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1
    POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1
    source ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh
fi
```

## (Optional) Configure Vim

To configure Powerline for Vim, add the following lines to your `~/.vimrc` file:

```vim
set rtp+=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/bindings/vim/
```

Optionally, add the following line to `~/.vimrc` to display the status bar in
Vim and make the Powerline status line visible by default:

```vim
set laststatus=2
```

## (Optional) Edit your Powerline configuration

You can customize what segments appear in Powerline, or even the behavior of
specific segments. The summarized instructions to customize your Powerline
installation is the following:

1. Copy the `~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/config_files/`
   folder to `~/.config/powerline`:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/powerline
   cp -R ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline/config_files/* \
         ~/.config/powerline/
   ```
1. Edit the files there according to your needs. A good starting point is the
   `~/.config/powerline/config.json` file.
1. Reload the Powerline daemon:
   ```sh
   powerline-daemon --kill
   ```
