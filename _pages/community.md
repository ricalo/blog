We encourage open and respectful discussions on DevPro Media. Use the following
guidelines and your best judgment before posting:

Stay on-topic
: Make sure that your comment matches the topic of the post. If the relationship
  between your comment and your post is not evident, explain it in a few words.

No self-promotion
: A comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article
  on another site will be removed.

Choose your words wisely
: Comments that contain profanity might be removed. Profanity used to insult,
  antagonize, or inflame will be removed.

Don’t be a jerk
: Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist,
  misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of
  people are not allowed.

Cite your sources
: If you didn’t write it, properly cite the article you’re quoting.

We continuously monitor the comments and update the guidelines accordingly.
